# Scoring matrix for property evaluation.
# Score measures "how much of what I want does this house have?"
# Price is NOT in the score — it becomes the denominator in a value ratio:
#   value_ratio = score / (price / 100k)
# Higher ratio = more bang for your buck.

criteria:
  lot_size_acres:
    weight: 40
    min: 0.5       # search filter minimum
    max: 5.0       # sweet spot — above this doesn't help much
    direction: higher_is_better

  commute:
    weight: 25
    scoring: threshold
    full_points_under: 20   # ≤20 min = 100% of weight
    zero_points_over: 46    # 46+ min = 0% of weight
    # Between 20 and 45: linear interpolation (45 min gets minimal points)

  bedrooms:
    weight: 20
    scoring: peak
    ideal: 3       # 3 bedrooms is perfect
    min: 1         # below this = 0 (search already filters 2+)
    max: 5         # above this = 0

  bathrooms:
    weight: 15
    min: 0         # so 1 bath = 50%, 2 bath = 100%
    max: 2         # 2 baths is heavenly — above still caps at 100
    direction: higher_is_better

# Boolean bonus features: flat points added after weighted average
bonuses:
  has_garage:
    points: 15     # almost essential
  has_basement:
    points: 5      # awesome but not a must
  has_fireplace:
    points: 3      # nice, but can build a firepit

# Properties scoring below this are not added to the spreadsheet
